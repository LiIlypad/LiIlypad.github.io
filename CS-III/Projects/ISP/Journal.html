       <div class="subH">Technical Challenges</div>
       <div class="journalPara">This week, our group was focusing on the animation, which was a struggle as none of us really know how to animate.</div>

       <div class="subH">Significant Achievements</div>
       <div class="journalPara">While this can't be shown in github, we spent a couple hours together and apart looking at the documentation to really understand how everything would move around to have an accurate animation</div>

       <div class="subH">Technical Challenges</div>
       <div class="journalPara">In this shorter week, we didn't make much progress on the actual ISP, instead we worked on the presentation that we would need to give.</div>

       <div class="journalPara">With my busy schedule, I don't have as much time outside of class as I would like to work on this project.</div>
       <div class="subH">Interpersonal Challenges</div>
       <div class="journalPara">We had minor disagreements over the format of the presentation (bullets vs. full sentences, design). Those were resolved quickly. </div>
      <div class="date">13-Feb-2023</div>
       <div class="subH">Technical Challenges</div>
       <div class="journalPara">This week we set up a base design for our webpage, which wasn't incredibly hard, but did take some messing around to get the exact colors and design we wanted. </div>
       <div class="subH">Scheduling Challenges</div>
       <div class="journalPara">With my busy schedule, I don't have as much time outside of class as I would like to work on this project.</div>
       <div class="subH">Interpersonal Challenges</div>
       <div class="journalPara">At one point, we actually had 2 completely different designs that we had to resolve into one final design.</div>
      <div class="date">6-Feb-2023</div>
       <div class="subH">Technical Challenges</div>
       <div class="journalPara">I had some issues this week with the git repository for my second project. (Most of my focus was here this week instead of MAE.) I, and some of my teammmates, had issues with connecting my shell to the repository, and there is currently notin in the repository because my teammate somehow pushed an empty repository to a full repository. (They're working on fixing it right now.)</div>
       <div class="subH">Scheduling Challenges</div>
       <div class="journalPara">With my busy schedule, I don't have as much time outside of class as I would like to work on this project.</div>
       <div class="subH">Interpersonal Challenges</div>
       <div class="journalPara">At the start of this week, one of our teammates left the project because they didn't understand how to expand it beyond the base requirements. Other then that, the only minor issues we've had have been disagreemets over the look of our project that were quickly resolved. </div>
      <div class="date">23-Jan-2023</div>
       <div class="subH">Technical Challenges</div>
       <div class="journalPara">We didn't know exactly how we wanted the simulation to look, so sketching took some time. Also none of us are incredibly skilled artists, so it took some effort to create passable sketches. </div>

       <div class="journalPara">With my busy schedule, I don't have as much time outside of class as I would like to work on this project.</div>
       <div class="subH">Interpersonal Challenges</div>
       <div class="journalPara">We had some minor disagreements over the direction that our sketches should go, but they were resolved quickly.</div>
      <div class="date">16-Jan-2023</div>
       <div class="subH">Technical Challenges</div>
       <div class="journalPara">Since we are still mainly in the research phase, we didn't really have any technical issues.</div>
       <div class="subH">Scheduling Challenges</div>
       <div class="journalPara">With my busy schedule, I don't have as much time outside of class as I would like to work on this project.</div>
       <div class="subH">Interpersonal Challenges</div>
       <div class="journalPara">My group didn't have many disagreements this week. We are mainly still researching, so there were only misunderstanding the research and then corrections to make sure that we're all on the same page, and know what's happening.</div>
       <div class="date">2-Jan-2023</div>
       <div class="subH">Software Development Engineer</div>
       <div class="journalPara">Software development engineers are in charge of designing and building the software, as well as fixing any errors that might occur. They take the brunt of the work in actual coding. I think that I would be a decent development engineer, but not outstanding. I'm good at learning new implementations and debugging, but I have gaps in my general knowledge that will take time to fill, and may lead to me implementing something in an incredibly ineffecint way, that could have been done much better had I just known how. </div>
       <div class="subH">QA Engineer</div>
       <div class="journalPara">QA stands for quaility assurance, and as such QA engineers are in charge of ensuring quality in software. They can work in both debugging and improvement of code. I have experience in QA from working on the model schedular last year, and I did well in some aspects and less good in others. I created an effective checklist to ensure that each feature worked correctly and smoothly, but didn't follow through on completing that checklist for every feature.</div>
       <div class="subH">Project Manager</div>
       <div class="journalPara">Project managers are in charge of making sure the project runs smoothly. They work mainly with timelines and budgets, keeping the team on track to finish in a timely manner while remaining in budget. I think that I could be a good project manager because I often work a similar process with my own personal projects. The main challenge that I would face would be communicating expected timelines with my team in an effective way, as well as incorrectly estimating the time it takes to learn and implement new technologies.</div>
       <div class="subH">Product Manager</div>
       <div class="journalPara">Product managers are often seen as team leaders. They are in charge of deciding what exactly the product will be, and leading the team into delivering that product. I think that I would be both a good and bad product manager. When I know that others might have a different opinion, I struggle to definitivly state my own. Depending on the team I work with, this could either be great, leading to a great collaborative product with everyone's ideas involved, or horrible, leading to a final product that is at war with itself on what it want to be. </div>
       <div class="subH">Release Engineer</div>
       <div class="journalPara">Release engineers work to deliver code into the repository in a streamlined way. I don't think that I would make a great release engineer, just because I struggle with understanding GitHub. I often have to look up simple things like switching branches in the shell, despite having done them many times, and at times a simple main vs. master branch error can confuse and delay me for an hour or more, unless I get help.</div>
