       <div>Bubble sort was the best sort by far, followed by insertion sort and then selection sort. The longest time bubble sort took was 324 millisecons, and that was even on an ordered file. Insertion sort took 4 minutes and 10 seconds at the longest, on a reverse-ordered file. Selection sort was unable to complete many of its tests, even on the ordered files. Bubble sort essentially works by carrying values through the array and swapping once a larger value is found, until the largest is at the end. This works to essentially sort from the back. Insertion sort is the opposite of that. It iterates through the array, swaping the vsmaller values towards the front for a front starting sort. Selection sort finds the smallest value, and moves that to the very front. Then it finds the second smallest value and puts that in second place. It continues this until the array is sorted. </div>
