	<div>ShelterSafe is a project that, while maybe being less useful in north Texas, would be very useful in many areas of the world more prone to natural disasters. It would be very rewarding to work on something that could noticeably help many people.</div>

	<div>Despite not eating in the cafeteria myself, I’ve heard many stories about people waiting in long lines and having only 2 or 3 minutes to actually eat their food. This concept of ordering food beforehand would really help in getting students their food quicker, and it has been proven to work on days like the PSAT, where students order their lunch before and get it at a certain time.</div>

	<a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/george-winters/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Bolt</a>
	<div>Bolt could be a very useful tool in helping students with computer science, or even in other subjects should the creators choose to broaden the scope a bit.</div>

	<div>There have been mornings when I wanted someone to tell me what to wear, and that is exactly what this app would do. It would be interesting to figure out how to filter ideas by the user’s preferences and to present outfits that for a certain aesthetic with only items currently in someone’s closet.</div>

	<div>I’ve played games like this before, like Goat Simulator, and found it extremely fun. Creating something like it that is just ridiculous would be extremely fun. I also think it would be fun to hide some easter eggs and fun little hidden challenges and such, and this game would allow for that very easily.</div>

      <div>I have found myself wondering what I should do with my friends many times. This app would help make that go away, and could even take us places we hadn’t known existed. It would also be fun to code, with creating a fun-looking interface and algorithms to give filtered suggestions.</div>

	<a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/lilly-seeley/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Castaway</a>
	<div>Castaway is our own proposal. It is useful and would be very challenging to create, with many filters and destinations. This would make planning a trip so much easier and help making memories so much easier.</div>
