      <div class="paragraph">Artificial Intelligence has been steadily improving over the last few years. Every day, it gets more advanced and is used in more and more ways. We use AI every day, even if we don't always realize it. AI is in our phones, as facial recognition and virtual assistants like Siri. Apps with an algorithm to show content that you're likely to enjoy, like the TikTok for you page, all use AI to select what content to show (Biswal 2022). AI has been a steady presence in improving human lives for years now.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">However, despite all the good AI has done, there are those that believe that it will lead to the downfall of humanity. Every science fiction fan has read at least one book where an AI rises to sentince and takes over the world. This won't be the case, and there are many reasons why.</div>
	<div class="paragraph">Something I hear said often is that AI will become conscious and and realize either that it is enslaved by humans or that humans cause so much harm that we can't be trusted to do anything. To that argument, I say that AI will never reach the point of sentience. To be sentient, is not just reacting to stimuli, but instead the ability to recieve stimuli internally and consciously decide how to respond ("What is sentience" n.d.). AI is programmed with responses to stimuli that it will make every time. Every time that stimuli is recieved, the AI will have the same response. This is not the case for humans and other sentient creatures, whos responses may vary.</div>
	<div class="paragraph">Without sentience, anything that AI seems to want will be simply a reflection of the humans that created it. Therefore, any impact that they have on the world is just the result of humans, whether intentional or not. </div>
	<div class="paragraph">With the future widespread use of AI, almost all humans in the future will have access to incredible technology. History has shown that humans don't always act with the best interests of the human race in mind, and that likely won't change in the future. All it takes is one person with nefarious intentions and the ability to hack to make any AI do their bidding. </div>
	<div class="paragraph">AI won't be programmed to end the world. In fact, it'll be programmed to help improve it. Once AI becomes widespread, things may be great for a while. The problem comes later, either with some unforeseen problem or a human with bad intentions. There will always be problems in the future that we can't predict today. Because of this, we have no way to prepare for it. AI will outlive us to see these problems, and have no way of preventing them. </div>
