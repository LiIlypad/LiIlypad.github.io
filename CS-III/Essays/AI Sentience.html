      <div class="paragraph">Artificial Intelligence has been steadily improving over the last few years. Every day, it gets more advanced and is used in more and more ways. We use </div>
	<div class="paragraph">First, I don't believe that AI will ever reach true sentience. Eventually, technology will be so advanced that it could resemble sentient beings, but it won't have true sentience. Any personality traits shown will have been programmed into it. Even if they can change over time like humans, it would be along the lines of some algorithm allowing it to do so. </div>
	<div class="paragraph">Without sentience, anything that AI seems to want will be simply a reflection of the humans that created it. Therefore, any impact that they have on the world is just the result of humans, whether intentional or not. </div>
	<div class="paragraph">With the future widespread use of AI, almost all humans in the future will have access to incredible technology. History has shown that humans don't always act with the best interests of the human race in mind, and that likely won't change in the future. All it takes is one person with nefarious intentions and the ability to hack to make any AI do their bidding. </div>
	<div class="paragraph">AI won't be programmed to end the world. In fact, it'll be programmed to help improve it. Once AI becomes widespread, things may be great for a while. The problem comes later, either with some unforeseen problem or a human with bad intentions. There will always be problems in the future that we can't predict today. Because of this, we have no way to prepare for it. AI will outlive us to see these problems, and have no way of preventing them. </div>
