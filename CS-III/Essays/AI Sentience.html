      <div class="paragraph">Artificial Intelligence has been steadily improving over the last few years. Every day, it gets more advanced and is used in more and more ways. We use AI every day, even if we don't always realize it. AI is in our phones, as facial recognition and virtual assistants like Siri. Apps with an algorithm to show content that you're likely to enjoy, like the TikTok for you page, all use AI to select what content to show (Biswal 2022). AI has been a steady presence in improving human lives for years now.</div>
      <div class="paragraph">However, despite all the good AI has done, there are those that believe that it will lead to the downfall of humanity. Every science fiction fan has read at least one book where an AI rises to sentince and takes over the world. This won't be the case, and there are many reasons why.</div>
	<div class="paragraph">Something I hear said often is that AI will become conscious and and realize either that it is enslaved by humans or that humans cause so much harm that we can't be trusted to do anything. To that argument, I say that AI will never reach the point of sentience. To be sentient, is not just reacting to stimuli, but instead the ability to recieve stimuli internally and consciously decide how to respond ("What is sentience" n.d.). AI is programmed with responses to stimuli that it will make every time. Every time that stimuli is recieved, the AI will have the same response. This is not the case for humans and other sentient creatures, whos responses may vary.</div>
	<div class="paragraph">Without sentience, AI doesn't decide what response it will have, humans do. The algorithms in AI that would cause it to be the downfall of humanity would have to be programmed by humans themselves. Because so many people have heard horror stories of controlling AI's, not everyone will be allowed to edit the AI's programming, and the people that are allowed won't have access to change the AI's fundamental purpose.</div>
	<div class="paragraph">Another thing that I hear often is that AI will take over all jobs, leaving humans with nothing to do. This won't happen, and past advances in technology similar to the one that AI is having now, have proved this. After the industrial revolution, there were still plenty of jobs for humans, despite machines taking over work that used to be done by human hands. In fact, there were more jobs, just like there will be even more when this new technological revolution comes to an end (Gaskill 2019).</div>
	<div class="paragraph">Despite the fears of many people, AI won't bring about humanity's downfall. Instead, it will send us soaring to new heights with new purpose and technology.</div>
