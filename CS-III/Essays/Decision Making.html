      <div class="paragraph">Decisions are made every day, and many factors go into those decisions. People try to make rational decisions, but there are certain biases that can influence their decisions without them even knowing. When working on projects, there are many decisions to be made, and biases to overcome. These are some of the biases that I think I’ll encounter while working on the ISP, and how I plan to overcome them. </div>
      <div class="subsubheading">Escalation</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Escalation is committing to a course of action even after it has proven to not give the desired results. I have shown this bias in the past, with other projects. I tend to get attached to ideas that I’ve spent a lot of time on, and will try to do whatever I can to get it to work, even if I know that the most efficient course of action would be to completely start over. Left unchecked, this bias would lead to a more complex then necessary final product at best, and at worst a complete failure. To combat this bias for the ISP, I will simply keep it in the back of my mind. Knowing that continuing with a failing plan is not simply resilience, but rather an error in a logical decision making process, will help me to not fall into the trap of getting too attached to my ideas.</div>
      <div class="subsubheading">Overconfidence</div>
      <div class="paragraph">Overconfidence is belief in yourself past the point of your abilities. I have shown this bias myself in many ways, mainly by showing up unprepared for a test despite believing I knew the material. For the ISP, I don’t think I’ll overestimate my abilities, because I know how to use resources on the Internet to find how to do anything I don’t currently know. Instead, I think that I will overestimate my commitment. I tend to overcommit to things, and end up working on projects too much in comparison to groupmates. This bias could lead to our project not ben=ing complete by the due date if not addressed. This ISP, I will make sure that the workload is spread evenly throughout our entire group, and know how much time I have to commit to this project.</div>
      <div class="subsubheading">Search</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The search bias is believing events to be more common based on how easily they are tested for. While I haven't specifically encountered this bias myself before, I believe that it will have an impact on this project. When testing our project for bugs or improvements, some tests will be easier than others. Testing that our project doesn’t break with a negative input will be much simpler than testing that our project doesn’t break with an input with over 12 digits, simply because of the time it takes to test the input. This could lead to a final product that breaks often and easily. To combat this, we will make a list of tests that need to be done and run them the same number of times.</div>
      <div class="subsubheading">Success</div>
      <div class="paragraph">The success bias is the belief that if something has failed, it was bad luck, but if something succeeded, it was a good decision. I encounter this bias when going over old tests. I only redo the questions that I missed, and even then I redo them the same way I originally did, assuming a math mistake was made rather than a concept error. I don’t even look at the questions I got right. I think that this will affect the ISP while testing. If something works on the first try, it will be accepted as working, and if it doesn’t, it will be retried until it does. Actually looking at and revising the code might end up as something of a last resort. To overcome this bias, we will create a list of every test that should be run, and decide on how many times each test should be run, whether or not it ends in success.</div>
      <div class="subsubheading">Confirmation</div>
	<div class="paragraph">Confirmation bias is only searching for evidence that supports what you are looking for, and not anything that disproves it. I’ve displayed this bias mostly when writing essays for school. I search for evidence that supports my thesis statement, but nothing that refutes it. This will affect our ISP in a very similar way as the success bias. We will test to prove that our project works, not try to find what breaks it. Similar to the search bias, this bias, if left unchecked, will lead to a final product that breaks often and easily. We will use the same method as the success bias to fix the confirmation bias. We will create a list of all the tests we need to run, and how many times we need to run them. When making this list, we will keep in mind that we need to not only prove that it works, but try to break the program so that we can make sure it never breaks.</div>
	<div class="paragraph">In the making of our ISP, we will encounter many decisions that we need to make, and many biases to affect those decisions. The escalation, overconfidence, success, search, and confirmation biases are some of the main biases that we will face, but there will be others as well. We will do our best to overcome these biases and make rational decisions.</div>
